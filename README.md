# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Experiments

This repository contains a collection of data analysis and machine learning experiments that showcase various techniques and algorithms. Each section focuses on a specific method or topic, providing practical implementations and insights.

## Repository Structure

1. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   - Explore basic statistics in `sample.csv`.  
   - Learn how to compute measures like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Preprocess data from `sample.csv`.  
   - Includes handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features.

3. **Univariate and Bivariate Graphics**  
   - Visualize data using graphs to explore individual variables and relationships between them.

4. **Data Visualization with Seaborn**  
   - Visualize the Iris dataset and synthetic data using Seaborn for advanced graphical representation.

5. **Statistical Tests with SciPy**  
   - Perform statistical tests such as Chi-square and t-tests using SciPy.

6. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
   - Implement PCA on custom datasets to reduce dimensionality and analyze important components.

7. **Find-S Algorithm**  
   - Implement the Find-S algorithm to find specific hypotheses in a dataset.

8. **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm**  
   - Implement a KNN model to classify test samples based on their nearest neighbors.

9. **Linear and Multiple Regression**  
   - Implement linear and multiple regression to predict continuous outcomes.

10. **Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet Regression**  
    - Implement these regression variants to regularize models and avoid overfitting.

11. **Logistic Regression**  
    - Explore logistic regression with randomly generated datasets to classify binary outcomes.

12. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**  
    - Implement SVM on the Iris dataset to classify species and analyze model performance.

13. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**  
    - Implement SVR to perform regression analysis on continuous data.
